# car-dealership
This is my first project on github, I am working front and back end with it.
Its a virutal car dealership that has a portal for users to log into, browse cars, select for purchase, seek financing and arrange for delivery.
I intend to use ReactJS or AngularJS as the front end frame work.
I intend to use Java Spring or node.js for back end.
IT is for my practice in full stack development.
Any help, support, ideas, criticisms are welcome.
